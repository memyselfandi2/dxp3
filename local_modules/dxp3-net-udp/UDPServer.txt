A broadcast address is a network address at which all devices connected to
a multiple-access communications network are enabled to receive datagrams.
A message sent to a broadcast address may be received by all network-attached hosts.
In contrast, a multicast address is used to address a specific group of devices and
an unicast address is used to address a single device.
Setting all the bits of an IP address to one, or 255.255.255.255, forms the limited broadcast address.
Sending a UDP datagram to this address delivers the message to any host on the local network segment.
Because routers never forward messages sent to this address, only hosts on the network segment
receive the broadcast message.
Broadcasts can be directed to specific portions of a network by setting all bits of the host identifier.
For example, to send a broadcast to all hosts on the network identified by IP addresses starting
with 192.168.1, use the address 192.168.1.255.

****************************************

node UDPServer -address <String> -destinations <Array> -encryption <String> -help
               -ignoreParent <Boolean> -ignoreOurselves <Boolean> -loglevel <String> <String>
               -mode <String> -port <Number> -reuseAddr <Boolean>

-address         <String>          - The optional address to listen on.
                                     When ommitted the operating system will attempt to listen on all addresses.
                                     Aliases: host.
-destinations    <Array>           - The comma separated list of destinations. Each mode will have a default set.
                                     Therefor this is optional.
-encryption      <String>          - The encryption key/password to use.
-help                              - Show this help content.
-ignoreParent    <Boolean>         - Set this to true to ignore messages send by other UDP clients or
                                     UDP servers running under the same process.
-ignoreOurselves <Boolean>         - Set this to true to ignore messages send by ourselves.
-loglevel        <String> <String> - A regular expression followed by one of trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal.
-mode            <String>          - One of directed-broadcast, limited-broadcast, multicast or unicast
                                     The different modes will send messages to:
                                     - everyone on a network (limited broadcast),
                                     - a subset of nodes (directed broadcast),
                                     - a group nodes have subscribed to (multicast), or
                                     - a specific set of nodes (unicast).
-port            <Number>            - The port the UDP server will listen on.
-reuseAddr       <Boolean>           - Set this to true if you need multiple UDP servers listening on the same port.

Typically one would use the UDPServerCLI to receive/send UDP messages from the command line.
However if you need to perform a quick test, you can run the UDPServer from the command line. On the sending end you'd probably run an UDPClient.

node UDPServer -loglevel * info -port 10123 -mode multicast -destinations 239.128.1.1 -ignoreParent false -ignoreOurselves true

const udp = require('dxp3-net-udp');
