Typically a database is backed by persistent storage.
However it is possible to run an ephemeral in-memory database.
That option is typically used in caching or user session scenarios.
Four command line interface programs are provided to configure and interact with databases:
1) DatabaseAdminCLI
2) DatabaseCLI
3) DatabaseServerCLI
4) DatabaseClientCLI

The DatabaseAdminCLI allows you to create, delete, list and rename filesystem backed databases.
Additionally it will let you create, delete, list and rename in-memory databases as a way to test/validate
their administration. As in-memory databases are not persisted they will disappear after the program ends.

The DatabaseCLI allows you to interact with the database and execute all the typical SQL queries.
This command line interface needs to be executed/run on the same computer the database is stored on.

To enable a client server database interaction use the dxp3-microservice-database module.
This module contains a DatabaseServer and a DatabaseClientCLI.
To start a DatabaseServer one must specify:
1) the name of the server (there could be more servers on the network. A name simply allows for easy identification),
2) the name of the filesystem persisted database (typically different from the name of the server),
3) the source folder of the filesystem persisted database,
4) what this database 'produces'. It allows database consumers to find this database.
   This can be something generic like 'storage' or more specific like 'cat-videos-db'

For example:
> node DatabaseServer -name database-server-one -databaseName db -sourcefolder C:\data\ -produces storage
> node DatabaseClientCLI -name database-client-one -consumes storage
